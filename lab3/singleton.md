# Singleton pattern
Sida 442
A singleton is usefull when we only require one instance of the object and that instance is used by many
different parts of the software.
One bad solution to this is to pass the object around as reference to where it is needed.
  
The singleton Pattern suggests that this object should have global visibility.
This is achieved by defining a static method of a class that returns a singleton.
